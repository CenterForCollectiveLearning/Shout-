			<div id="how-it-works-bullets">
				When you start a trade, Shout! gives you the option to select an exchange "with" or "without" review. If you choose to trade without review, retweets will be directly triggered through your account. If you choose to trade with review, you can review tweets before they come out.</div>

			<span id="intro-heading-text">Why would I trade retweets in a marketplace instead of just asking my friends?</span>
		</div>
		<div class="info-text">
			<div id="how-it-works-bullets">
				<p>Sure, you can always call your friend on the phone and ask them to retweet you :-), but Shout! makes this simpler. The use of a marketplace facilitates the coordination of the exchange, the tracking of previous exchanges, and the speed of the transaction. </p>
				<p>Shout! allows you to set up many trades at once, and keeps track of how many retweets are owed on both sides. This way, you and your friends are less likely to lose track of the deals you have agreed on.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="info-text">
			<div id="how-it-works-bullets">
				<p>Shout! gives you control over what to retweet through the people you trade with, so you should be careful about who you enter a relationship with. We suggest you only enter relationships with people you know, or at least, mutually follow on twitter.</p>

				<p>No. Your traders do not have direct access to your Twitter account. They cannot tweet as you,retweet anyone other than themselves, orretweet themselves more times than what you agreed on the original offer.</p>
