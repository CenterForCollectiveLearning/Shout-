			<p>Shout! is a marketplace for retweets. </p>
			<p>Shout helps people with a medium to small number of Twitter followers to act as a group, coordinating their retweets and extending their reach. Shout! is a tool to empower communities that already exist within Twitter.</p>
			<p>If you have a Twitter account, you probably belong to some implicit community. Maybe you and your friends are journalists, who like to retweet each other's articles. Or perhaps you and your friends all work in the same neighborhood and want to bring more customers to your street, so you retweet each other to increase boost the area's popularity.</p>
			<p>These are just a few examples of cases where people can benefit from leveraging their social networks and multiplying their voices.</p>
			<p>However, coordinating retweets is both time consuming and time critical, as Twitter is a fast paced platform where attention can shift quickly. </p>
			<p>Shout! allows you to solve this coordination problem by creating micro-contracts with your friends that allow you to pre-specify a retweet exchange (i.e. I'll retweet you 5 times if you retweet me 2 times). </p>
			<p>How does Shout work?</p>
			<p>Easy.</p>
			<p> 1. Login with twitter. </p>
			<p> 2. Find a person to start a retweet relationship with. </p>
			<p> 3. Bargain a trade-ratio. [Screenshot of “make a deal” screen]</p>
			<p>4. Trigger retweets directly from Shout! [Screenshot of “Send tweet through X’s account]</p>
			<p>While you can certainly connect with your friends through email, phone, whatsapp, soma, twitter direct message, facebook messenger, snapchat, or any other social media platform, the use of a marketplace facilitates the coordination of the exchange, the tracking of previous exchanges, and the speed of the transaction (since twitter is time critical).</p>

			Frequently Asked Questions
		</div>
		<div class="info-text">
			<p class="faq-question"><b>Why would I trade retweets through a marketplace when I could just ask my friend to retweet my tweets for me?</b></p>
			<p>While you can certainly connect with your friends through email, phone, whatsapp, soma, twitter direct message, facebook messenger, snapchat, or any other social media platform, the use of a marketplace facilitates the coordination of the exchange, the tracking of previous exchanges, and the speed of the transaction (since twitter is time critical). </p>
			<p>Shout! allows you to set up many trades at once, and keeps track of your trade activity and how many retweets are owed on both sides. This way, you and your friends are less likely to lose track of deals you have agreed on.</p>
			<p>Also, In an in-person interaction, retweets happen on your friend’s schedule. However, with Shout!, you can trigger retweets when you want, giving you greater control over the process. </p>
			<p class="faq-question"><b>What should I look out for? </b></p>
			<p>Shout! gives you complete control over your retweet relationships, so you should be careful about who you enter a relationship with. We suggest you only enter relationships with people you know, or at least, follow each other on twitter (so you can direct message them in case of an issue). Also, you can always undo the retweets one of your friends triggered in your account, but that could be considered an inadequate behavior (a brech of the mico-contract). </p>
			<p class="faq-question"><b>Can someone I have traded retweets with do anything other than retweet them as me? (i.e. can they tweet as me, or read my private messages?)</b></p>
			<p>No. Your traders do not have direct access to your Twitter account. They cannot tweet as you or access your account in any way. They can also, not retweet anyone other than themselves, and they cannot retweet themselves more times than what you agreed on the original offer.</p>
			<p class="faq-question"><b>Where can I report bugs / complaints/ comments? </b></p>
			<p>We’d love to hear from you! Give us a shout at: shout@media.mit.edu</p>
			<p class="faq-question"><b>Who are we?</b></p>
